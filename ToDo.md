## MARC usage

In 2013 OCLC did an research project about "[MARC Usage in WorldCat](https://www.oclc.org/research/areas/data-science/marcusage.html)". 

“Ground Truthing” MARC

For example, look at how many ways we have recorded the fact that an item includes “illustrations”. It’s clear that processing any of our data will require a lot of normalization, at minimum, to be able to understand that “ill.” and “illustrations” and “ilustrations” and “ilustr.” and “il.” and whatever, all mean the same thing.
