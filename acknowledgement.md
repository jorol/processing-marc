# Acknowledgement

The manual "[Einführung in die Verarbeitung von PICA-Daten](https://pro4bib.github.io/pica/#/)" by [Jakob Voß](https://github.com/nichtich) was use as a template for this tutorial. 

The technical infrastructure for providing this manual was copied from [Felix Lohmeier](https://felixlohmeier.de/), who, by the way, also provides other interesting introductions to data processing topics for library and cultural institutions. 

Thanks to [Roy Tennant](http://roytennant.com/speaker.html) and [Péter Király](https://pkiraly.github.io/) for their research on MARC. 

Special thanks to all open source developers and the [Catmandu](https://librecat.org/) community for providing the tools.
